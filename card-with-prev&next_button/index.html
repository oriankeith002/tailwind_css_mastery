        <p class="mt-4">This book takes a completely different approach. 
            I won't teach you the things flex and grid can do. Instead, 
            I will first show you some components and layouts and make you think
             how to build them using the CSS concepts you already know. 
             Now you have a problem, and you want a solution.
